SPACE FARM: A game with contributions Zachary Kline, Matthew Perry, Samantha Kyle, and Dennis Christenson

========================================================

CONCEPT

========================================================

You're a farmer in space, and need to expand your space farm empire enough to feed the SPACE WHALE at the edge of the galaxy which theatens to swallow your farm space station. The more animals you get the more resources you gain. You can butcher animals for their parts, and then stitch them together using SUPER SCIENCE to create animal abominations, or use the parts to purchase upgrades! Once you've gathered up enough resources and animals, load them into your SPACE CANNON and fire them into the whale's mouth and SAVE YOUR SPACE STATION. With it's hunger sated, it will leave you gifts which will make your life easier next time around.

========================================================

ANIMALS

========================================================

All of the animals are gene spliced hybrids of sheep.

========================================================

UPGRADES => WILL PROBABLY BE CALLED THE BARN OR TOOLSHED

ALTAR/MAYBE BUTCHERY?

========================================================

The altar is a place where you can sacrifice animals to your horrifying space gods for animal parts and blood. Each main animal has 3 - 4 special parts which can be gained from sacrificing them, and you can use those parts to purchase upgrades, use in the laboratory to create specialty animals, or (stretch goal) use the parts to create breeding animals to gain more animals over time.

PERCENTAGES ARE BASE VALUES BEFORE UPGRADES
=== Sheep ===
Squared Eyes - One or two chance per sacrifice (CPS)
Sheep Hooves - 10% CPS
Pristine Wool - 5% CPS

LABORATORY

========================================================

The laboratory is where you can create specialty animals using parts from various animals in large quantities and a lot of the universal resource blood to make abominations the likes the world has never seen. These animals and made once, and never can be made again until a reset happens, they provide massive bonuses and (stretch goal?) can be made to level up using even more parts, evolving them into further horrors.
A list needs to be made for ideas of specialty animals, so that should be a high priority for now until we get it done.

Lab ideas: Maybe have it so only one of the speciality animals can be active at a time, and they give crazy bonuses. Maybe with the resource mechanic we can make it so you can buy slots to activate the other animals using the resource, for a lot of resources. That way there is a bit of reward for playing long term. (stretch goal idea) - maybe the "speciality" animals could level up as they are used, giving them further bonuses over time, or maybe the amount of times they are chosen as the "speciality" animal? This would require the ability to only make 1 - (however many purchased) available each game until reset.

========================================================

UX OVERHAUL

========================================================

Lets be honest the game looks bad, we need to fix that. Add animations, maybe subtle sounds that aren't supremely irritating, 
========================================================

STRETCH GOALS

========================================================

Below is a list of stretch goals beyond the original scope of the project
========================================================

BREEDING CENTER

========================================================

A spot where you can use materials and animals to create breeding versions of the animals which automatically raise the amount of the animals
========================================================

ACHIEVEMENTS

========================================================

Everyone loves achievements, it totally isn't a cheap way to incentivize playing much longer than a game warrents. No of course not.
ANYWAY achievements would basically be for random goals like a certain number of sheep or stuff like that, and get weirder the more you go. Cookie Clicker did it, so why not us. WHY NOT US I ASK YOU?
========================================================

SAVING USING COOKIES

========================================================

Something I'm very unfamiliar with, but would be important for the game to have any real staying power.
========================================================

MORE ANIMALS/UPGRADES/WHATEVER!

========================================================

Theres a ton more animals and upgrades that could be added.
========================================================

USE CLASS SYNTAX INSTEAD OF FUNCTIONAL

========================================================

We're currently using functional javascript for the whole game, but we could alternatively upgrade it to class syntax, or maybe object oriented eventually?
========================================================

AUTO SACRIFICER

========================================================

If the breeding center stretch goal is done, I'd like to do a auto sacrificer where you can have a machine or something you
